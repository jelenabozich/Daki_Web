                                My journey into physiotherapy began when my wife was diagnosed with MS. We were faced with seemingly hopeless situation and left without a satisfactory explanation or help from medical professionals. Difficulties we faced together has fueled my interest and education in the field as well as an intense drive to finding the most effective approach to treating individuals affected by MS. The result was a unique treatment, targeting both physical and psychological symptoms with great success rate.

                                <h3>In order to determine the necessary therapy and its approximate length, it is necessary to agree on the shortest time that we can see through Skype to establish an anamnesis. The patient can then decide whether and when to apply the therapy that is being used here. It is noted that the camera that displays the patient should be distant from the patient as much as it takes to see it in its entirety. (in a sitting or lying position) The therapy in the first week consists of four parts.
                                    <li>Talk with the patient about his symptoms, psychological profile, the environment in which he lives and general introduction.</li>
                                    <li>Bio energetic therapy with which the aura (which represents an energy indicator) complements, balances and regenerates in the areas where the symptoms are expressed.</li>
                                    <li>Psychotherapy, which changes the image of its capabilities, the experience of external situations and events, changing habits and perception, fulfilling real personal needs.</li>
                                    <li>Physical therapy that achieves movements that are difficult or impossible for the patient because of the condition in which they are present. In the second week and further (if needed), the therapy is done without bioenergy therapy, that is, with psychotherapy and physical therapy.Therapy should not take place in this order or that all four parts of therapy, but the emphasis is put on the individual needs of each patient.In the first week, the therapy takes place for 5 days in a row (Monday to Friday) at the same time each day, which is agreed with the patient prior to the arrangement. The duration of the daily therapy is 1 hour and a maximum of 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
                                    <li>It is especially emphasized that without the patient’s actual will to change behavior and habits this therapy will not have complete success. That’s why the therapy is exclusively done and scheduled with a patient, not with a cousin, a friend or any other person. They should be present if the patient needs help or curiosity for any reason. The therapy is conducted in Serbian and English, and may also be in French. All the information you need about the therapy, the agreement about the length of the therapy price and the method of payment via e-mail</li>

                                <h3>How can you assess something without seeing me in person?</h3>
                                <p>Assessing a person is a highly skilled process which takes years to develop. Physiotherapist’s are trained extensively in this important skill. There have been many studies reporting both the accuracy and patient satisfaction of a physiotherapist’s assessment and diagnosis. Assessment consists of two components: firstly, a subjective assessment or history and secondly, an objective assessment or physical. Any good clinician will tell you that the most important component to an accurate diagnosis is good history taking, and this can be performed exceptionally well in person, on the phone, or by video messaging by a skilled physiotherapist. In most circumstances, the clinician can be quite certain of the diagnosis after the history alone, and the physical assessment merely confirms the diagnosis and establishes some base line measurements for future reference. The use of webcams allows the therapist to walk a person through the physical assessment, allowing them to confirm the diagnosis and establish baseline measurements that can be reassessed in the future to check progress. There have been several studies comparing the accuracy of online versus in person assessments, including multiple sclerosis, all of which showed excellent (statistically significant) correlation </p>

                                <p>A common misconception of physio therapy is that it must involve hands-on treatment. In reality, this is only one tool available to a therapist in diagnosing and treating an injury or chronic condition. Educating patients, identifying contributing personal lifestyle and fitness factors, as well as implementing a specific exercise or movement program, are some of the most important things physios do. Modern physio therapy is no longer reliant on complex machines and manual techniques, and is trending towards guided self-care and coordinated rehabilitation programs, granting you much-needed control of your own recovery. Research has shown that outcomes are enhanced, if not realistically better through online consultation, due to the personal empowerment and easy facilitation we offer. </p>

                                <p>In the clinic, physio therapy evaluations start with a 'subjective assessment' in which the therapist will ask a series of questions to discover what they need to know about your injury. By the end of this initial interview, the therapist should have a very clear idea of your probable diagnosis, based on patient self-reporting alone. At this point, the therapist may perform some hands-on tests to confirm their assessment.Similarly, Blade will have you perform certain movements and ask further questions after each of these movements, and will then assess your feedback regarding each phase of the evaluation. This process will clarify the diagnosis and lead to the most likely solutions. If I am ever unsure of your diagnosis, I will not hesitate to refer you to a clinic for an in-person evaluation.</p>

                                <p>My name is Nada Nikolić. I was a talented, emotional and skinny child and lived in a small apartment in Novi Sad with my mother, father and sister. I was in the first grade of elementary school when I started hearing the arguments. My parent’s divorce was a nasty affair that lasted for a long, long time. Moving to Belgrade and relocating to grandma’s place with my mother has brought some order into our lives.
                                </p>
                                <p>They tried to give us everything they could, but they could not erase the past. I remember that I was often irreconcilably upset and would get extremely frightened in certain situations. In fact, I didn’t know it then, but that’s when I began experiencing very intense panic attacks. I became confused and aggressive. All the events that happened in my life and my inability to deal with them, along with my character, made for a good basis for the development of any illness.</p>

                                <p>One evening in 1995, I was lost in thought while coming home from work. I got into a car accident. The car hit me head on. Luckily, I didn’t break anything and survived, but I would start shaking at the mere thought of it.</p>

                                <p>Three months later, a buzzing in my ear started up, like it’s wont to with most people. However, the whistling intensified throughout the evening. I was pretty frightened when I fell asleep. In the morning, the sound was so intense that I was paralyzed with fear. The next day, my vision suddenly weakened in one eye. When I went to get checked, they found out that I’ve lost 90% of my hearing, but didn’t know the cause. However, when I went to an ophthalmologist, they said everything seemed fine, even though I complained about the sensation in my. I was completely confused. So scared that I didn’t eat anything. The fingers on my hands would go numb, as would my chest, as though I was in some sort of armor. My hearing improved, but did not return completely. I often had dizzy spells and vision problems. I would complain of that, but nothing was amis during my medical checks.</p>

                                <p>People slowly started to think that I was a hypochondriac and would make jokes on the subject … And I was just so scared …The problems were present and would disturb me in my work. As a professor of design and an illustrator, I was sometimes unable to draw and would get tired very quick. I learned to live like that.</p>

                                <p>We got married in ’96 and the year after I gave birth to a gorgeous little daughter. It wasn’t long after the birth that new troubles arose. Every new day in the period to come was painted with fear, worry and doubt in a recovery.</p>

                                <p>I started that would wake me at night and my whole arm numbness … I started having dizzy spells that would wake me up at night and my arm would start to go numb… I started with faking my bravery, but I couldn’t really withstand the fear anymore! I took a medical encyclopedia and read through illnesses and conditions, starting from the letter A. When I got to the letter M, I saw a small little text describing the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis … I read it… I was left staring at that text that was so accurate. It was as though I was expecting it to expand into another passage in which a cure would be mentioned … My heart plummeted. I was paralyzed with fear … for a good five minutes.</p>

                                <p>The pressure and anxiety I felt were so great that I had to visit a neurologist. I relayed my suspicion that I had multiple sclerosis to him. After a detailed examination, they found out that I had carpal tunnel syndrome – something benign. He told me to put an end to the doubts in my mind about having MS! The prescribed therapy was “Hepathrombin” crème.</p>

                                <p>One January morning in the year 2000, I woke up with my left hand and crotch area numb. I would check how much I could feel and whether the numbness was increasing by putting pressure on the area. Everyone around me noticed my absentmindedness. At one point, both of my legs were numb and heavy. I would walk, and not feel myself walking. I stumbled around when walking on the street. My hand was like wood. I felt helpless. I stopped thinking about it. I did not know what to do. I didn’t complain anymore. I stoped saying anything to anyone. Out of spite. Anger and spite killed me. I was furious at everything. Furious that I couldn’t figure anything out, that I’m wasn’t smart anymore, that I’ve been complaining for five years, and that I no longer felt myself walking. I did not even feel it when I urinated.</p>

                                <p>At home, I wouldn’t be able to unbutton my shirt or put on socks on my child’s feet. I stopped collecting change in coins at the store. And if I did try to, it was so slow that I would feel the eyes of the frustrated people behind me in line on my back, and hear their thoughts that were so very loud: “Look at her, drunk since dawn … stumbling around as she walks and trying to make herself seem fine by collecting the change, as if she even knows how much there should be. She can’t even collect it. Shame on her!” I constantly kept imagining what others must think.</p>

                                <p>Something wonderful happened during these hard times. I got pregnant the second time! I was genuinely happy after such a long time.</p>

                                <p>During the pregnancy, almost all of the difficulties stopped and I felt blissful. I was convinced that I was cured! And in 2001 I gave birth to a boy, a little angel. One morning, I tried to get out of bed. I couldn’t. My body was not my own. They took me to the hospital … CSF, magnetic resonance, scanner … And then it happened … The diagnosis – multiple sclerosis …
                                </p>
                                <p>The astonishing thing was that everyone was worried, and I was just thinking: “God, finally! Now give me a cure!” Yet there was no cure … Only small or non-existant repairs with a nasty therapy of corticosteroids. I didn’t immediately understand that it could get even harder, and it soon became just that. What they called “a relapse” in medicine would happen every 6 months. I searched for a cure. I spent a lot of money on rakija’s and herbal tinctures that would “cure MS in a month”, electrotherapy, kinesis therapy, Ayurveda (Indian therapy). I signed up to be a trial bunny at the neurology department for a “new” drug. I stopped eating meat. I was melting away. Movement was either very difficult or impossible. I would crawl from my room to the toilet. Speech was difficult to me. My wishes and my capabilities were separated by an abyss… I became depressed.
                                </p>
                                <p>I read a lot of different books. I found out about vitamin D in 2003 and even then realized how important it was. I took vitamin D on my own according to the instructions of Dr. John Canell and Liz Lipski. Only 7 years after did my neurologist instruct me to start taking vitamin D in large quantities, if I haven’t done so already!!! Dear God … I was one light year ahead of my doctor!</p>

                                <p>I encountered articles and shows about apitherapy (bee stings and using bee products) a couple of times. I watched a show In 2003. about Pet Wagner who had MS, and how the bee stings changed her life. I was willing to try it! And try I did.</p>

                                <p>I asked a friend to bring me a couple of bees to sting me. I would get stung by a bee every day and … after seven days there was a sudden improvement! I straightened up and started walking … the spasms eased up, my hand coordination came back and I was able to lift up my two-year-old child for the first time in the last year! It was a miracle for me, and I thought I had found a cure. A friend brought me a small hive to the apartment, and I contacted Pet Wagner and got a book with a scheme on how to use bees stings. But that summer my condition worsened and everything went back to the way it was before. I weakened psychologically so much that my neurologist prescribed me antidepressants. I just had no strength sometimes.</p>

                                <p>My mother (my father had already died) skillfully hid her feelings, but I knew it was difficult for her. I can’t imagine what it’s like to have a child with a diagnosis for which there is no cure. In 2005, she bought me a wheelchair. I was a little afraid that once I sat in them, I would never rise again! She encouraged me the way only she knew how and said to me: “You will use them as a means of transport to get from the house to a cafe, so that we can go have a drink!”</p>

                                <p>My sister brought me the most beautiful gift in the world when she came back from abroad. An electric red mobile scooter which quickly became my best friend! I would get to wherever I wanted to with it day in and day out. That device allowed me to move around the city again, to go shopping, and to freely take my children for a walk. Not to be locked within four walls. I started being aware and enjoying things more. Hanging out with friends more. Relaxing more.</p>

                                <p>By a stroke of luck, I heard from several people about the bioenergeticist Zdenko Domancic in Kranjska Gora. I took it as a sign and I scheduled an appointment with him. I was there in the wheelchair. I saw many people sick with various illnesses. People have come from all over the world. The first thing I heard was: “Blessed are those who believe, yet do not see!” I immediately accepted it, relaxed, and decided to believe everything would get better, and I didn’t even know how this bioenergy thing worked.</p>

                                <p>After the third day, I suddenly felt my body stopped spasming, my legs were more mobile, and the state I was in was surprising and unbelievably calm. The next day, I got out of the wheelchair and came to a session on two crutches! I was in awe of how all of that was possible, yet to the therapist who worked with me, that was the expected outcome! I was happy! That was the state in which I returned home.</p>

                                <p>My husband Draško was immediately interested in this form of treatment, since there was a possibility that Zdenko Domancic’s biotherapy could be learned. He left his previous job in construction and went into a serious adventure that will forever change our lives for the better! He also enrolled into the Faculty of medicine and got his bachelor’s degree in physiotherapy.
                                </p>
                                <p>Through applying his knowledge of medicine and biotherapy, and through using all of the knowledge from the experience of living with me and with some of the people close to us who had the same or a similar diagnosis, Draško helped not only me, but also many others who can say the same. Day to day, and year to year, I kept getting better. The basis is relaxation. This is in many ways impeded by fear and bombardment of various thoughts. At first, it’s hard to accept that you can get drastically better just from changing your approach and way of thinking. But he showed me, when I couldn’t perform a certain movement, how different it could be after only a few minutes, when I was relaxed and focused, how I could make this movement slowly, easily, without any problems. He showed me how completely everything depended on me, that I had to take control of my life. He often went with me to the pool. He taught me how and how much to practice, how physical therapy should be applied when you have neurological symptoms. It
                                    was important to do a bit, slowly, but correctly. To engagement my body in full. To correct my walk and the posture of my body. Then I started to explore on my own as well exactly what and how much I can do.</p>

                                <p>Today, I can walk without crutches, drive a bike and spend quality time with my family. I’ve learned how to overcome this condition called MS. I’ve learned how to forgive everyone and how to respect them, how to forgive myself, how not to be angry and bitter about life. I’ve learned to understand myself and listen to what I need. I have reduced the great abyss between my desires and my capabilities. Most importantly, I’ve learned how to slow down. I’m still learning how to stay in the here and now, how to deal with my ghosts, which sometimes come out and drag me back. They knock on my shoulders and ask: “Do you remember how you were before?”</p>

                                <b>How I was before doesn’t matter.</b>
                                <br>

                                <b>What matters is how I am now and how I will get better and better! For you as well. Forget about how it was before! What’s important is how you are now and what you will do now to make sure you will get better.</b>
